## Spotify Clone

## Project Description
 A Spotify clone built with REACT that allows a user to search for songs and be able to click a link and play that song in a new tab.

## How the app works
When the page loads you are prompted in the input box to search for an artist.  A list of songs come up after you search and when you click on one you are taken to a new tab where you are able to play that song.

## Technologies Used
React, Css, Axios, Bootstrap and CLI
